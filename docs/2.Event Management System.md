# College Management App - Documentation
## Part 2: Event Management System

---

## 1. Event Management Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

The Event Management System forms the core functionality of the application. It enables faculty, club coordinators, and administrators to create, manage, and promote events while providing students with an intuitive interface to discover and engage with college activities.

The system handles the complete event lifecycle from initial creation through post-event analysis, supporting multiple event types and categories with customizable settings for each.

### 1.2 Event Categories

Events are organized into five primary categories to help users discover relevant activities:

| Category | Description | Typical Examples |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Academic | Educational and scholarly events | Seminars, lectures, workshops, symposiums |
| Cultural | Arts and cultural programs | Music concerts, dance performances, drama |
| Sports | Athletic competitions and activities | Tournaments, matches, fitness events |
| Technical | Technology and innovation focused | Hackathons, tech talks, coding competitions |
| Workshops | Skill development sessions | Training programs, hands-on sessions |

Each category can have subcategories for more granular organization. For example, Technical events might include subcategories like AI/ML, Web Development, Mobile Development, and Cybersecurity.

## 3. Event Creation and Management

### 3.1 Creating New Events

#### Access Control

Only users with Faculty, Club Coordinator, or Admin roles can create events. Club coordinators can only create events under their associated club. The create event button appears prominently on the dashboard for authorized users.

#### Event Creation Flow

**Step 1: Basic Information**
- Event title (required, max 100 characters)
- Event description (required, rich text editor support)
- Category and subcategory selection
- Event date and time selection (date picker, time picker)
- Venue details (auto-complete from saved venues)

**Step 2: Visual Content**
- Upload event poster (required, max 5MB)
- Add additional images (optional, max 3 images)
- Image preview and crop functionality
- Automatic compression before upload

**Step 3: Registration Settings**
- Set maximum capacity (or unlimited)
- Enable/disable waitlist
- Set registration opening and closing dates
- Toggle approval requirement
- Add custom registration form fields

**Step 4: Targeting and Visibility**
- Select visibility level (public, specific departments, club members)
- Choose target departments (multiple selection)
- Select target years (for students)
- Add search tags

**Step 5: Additional Options**
- Enable attendance tracking
- Certificate availability toggle
- Select certificate template (if applicable)
- Add organizer contact information

**Step 6: Review and Publish**
- Preview event as students would see it
- Save as draft or publish immediately
- Schedule publish date/time (optional)

#### Validation Rules

The system validates all required fields before allowing submission. Event dates must be in the future. Registration closing date must be before event date. Capacity must be a positive number. Images must be in supported formats (JPG, PNG). Contact information must include valid email format.

### 3.2 Event Editing

#### Edit Permissions

Event creators can edit their own events at any time. Admins can edit any event. Club coordinators can edit events under their club. The edit option appears in the event details screen for authorized users.

#### Editable vs. Non-Editable Fields

**Always Editable**
- Event description, additional images, organizer contact
- Registration closing date (can extend)
- Capacity (can increase only if registrations open)
- Tags and visibility settings

**Conditionally Editable**
- Event date/time (only if no registrations yet, or with notifications to registered users)
- Venue (requires notification to registered users)
- Category (only before publishing)

**Never Editable After Publishing**
- Event ID, creation timestamp, original creator

#### Edit Notification System

When critical details change (date, time, venue), the system automatically sends notifications to all registered participants. Users receive both push notifications and email alerts about the changes. The notification includes old vs. new information clearly highlighted.

### 3.3 Event Deletion and Cancellation

#### Event Cancellation

Organizers can cancel published events with active registrations. The cancellation flow requires a mandatory reason for cancellation. All registered users receive immediate notification with the cancellation reason. Registration fees (if applicable) are marked for refund processing. The event moves to "cancelled" status but remains visible in event history.

#### Event Deletion

Draft events can be deleted completely without notifications. Published events with zero registrations can be deleted. Events with registrations cannot be deleted, only cancelled. Admins have override capability with audit logging. Deletion is permanent and removes all associated data including images.

### 3.4 Duplicate Event Feature

Organizers can duplicate existing events to save time on recurring activities. The duplicate function creates a new draft event with copied details. Title automatically appends "(Copy)" to avoid confusion. Date, time, and registration dates are cleared and must be set manually. Registration count and participant data are not copied. The new event receives a fresh event ID.

## 4. Event Discovery and Browsing

### 4.1 Event Listing Screen

#### Default View

The home screen displays upcoming events in chronological order with the nearest events first. Each event card shows the poster thumbnail, title, category badge, date/time, venue, and registration status indicator. A floating action button provides quick access to filters and search.

#### Event Card Information

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Event Poster Thumbnail]       │
│                                  │
│  Event Title                     │
│  📅 Date & Time                  │
│  📍 Venue                        │
│  👥 50/100 Registered            │
│  [Category Badge]                │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### List Organization Options

Users can toggle between different view modes:
- **Card View**: Large cards with poster images
- **Compact View**: Smaller cards, more events per screen
- **Calendar View**: Month calendar with event markers

### 4.2 Search Functionality

#### Search Interface

A search bar at the top accepts text input with real-time suggestions. As users type, the system suggests matching event titles, categories, organizers, and venues. Search history is maintained locally for quick access to frequent searches.

#### Search Criteria

The search indexes multiple fields including event title, description, category, subcategory, organizer name, venue name, and tags. Search is case-insensitive and supports partial matching. Results are ranked by relevance using a weighted algorithm (title matches score higher than description matches).

### 4.3 Filter System

#### Available Filters

**Category Filter**
- Multiple selection allowed
- Shows event count per category
- Apply/clear all options

**Date Range Filter**

#### Filter Combination

Multiple filters work together with AND logic. For example, selecting "Technical" category AND "This Week" shows only technical events happening this week. Active filters display as chips above the event list with individual remove options. A "Clear all filters" button resets to default view.

### 4.4 Event Calendar View

#### Calendar Interface

The calendar view displays a monthly grid with colored dots indicating events on specific dates. Different colors represent different categories following the category color scheme. Users can swipe between months. Tapping a date shows all events scheduled for that day in a bottom sheet.

#### Calendar Features

**Month Navigation**: Swipe horizontally or use arrow buttons to change months.

**Event Density Indicator**: Dates with multiple events show a number badge.

**Today Highlight**: Current date is visually distinguished with a border or background.

## 6. Event Registration Settings

### 6.1 Registration Capacity Management

#### Capacity Types

**Limited Capacity**: Organizers set a maximum number of participants. Registration closes automatically when capacity is reached. Users see real-time seat availability.

**Unlimited Capacity**: No registration limit. Useful for virtual events or large venues. Organizers can still track registration count.

**Waitlist Enabled**: When capacity is reached, users can join a waitlist. If someone cancels, the first person on the waitlist gets notified and has 24 hours to confirm registration.

#### Dynamic Capacity Updates

Organizers can increase capacity at any time. Increasing capacity automatically notifies waitlist users in order. Decreasing capacity is only allowed if current registrations are below the new limit. The system prevents setting capacity below current registration count.

### 6.2 Registration Timeline

#### Opening and Closing Dates

Organizers set when registrations open and close. Registration button appears disabled with a countdown timer before the opening date. After the closing date, registration automatically closes even if seats are available. Users receive notifications when registration opens for events they've bookmarked.

#### Early Bird Registration (Optional)

Organizers can enable priority registration for specific user groups (club members, department students). Early registration opens 24-48 hours before general registration. After the early period ends, remaining seats open to all eligible users.

### 6.3 Custom Registration Forms

#### Form Builder

Organizers can add custom fields to the registration form beyond basic name and email. Available field types include text input, number input, dropdown selection, multiple choice checkboxes, radio buttons, and file upload.

#### Example Custom Fields

For workshops: "Skill level" (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
For sports: "T-shirt size", "Emergency contact"
For technical events: "GitHub profile", "Areas of interest"
For competitions: "Team name", "Team members"

#### Required vs. Optional Fields

Organizers mark each custom field as required or optional. Required fields must be completed before registration submission. Field validation ensures proper data format (e.g., valid URLs for profile links).

### 6.4 Approval-Based Registration

#### When to Use Approval

Some events require organizer approval before registration is confirmed. This is useful for limited workshops requiring specific prerequisites, exclusive events with guest speakers, or competitions with qualification criteria.

#### Approval Workflow

**Step 1**: User submits registration with required information.

**Step 2**: Registration enters "Pending" status. User receives acknowledgment notification.

**Step 3**: Organizer reviews application in their dashboard.

**Step 4**: Organizer approves or rejects with optional reason.

**Step 5**: User receives notification of decision.

#### Organizer Dashboard for Approvals

The dashboard shows all pending registrations with submitted information. Organizers can filter by submission date, sort by criteria, or search by participant name. Bulk approval option available for multiple registrations. Rejection requires a brief reason that is shared with the applicant.

## 7. Event Analytics and Reporting

### 7.1 Event Statistics Dashboard

#### Overview Metrics

Organizers access analytics from the event management screen. Key metrics displayed include:

- Total registrations count
- Attendance rate (after event completion)
- Registration timeline graph
- Cancellation rate
- Waitlist conversion rate
- Average rating (from post-event feedback)

#### Registration Analytics

**Registration Over Time Graph**: Line chart showing daily registration counts from opening to closing date. Helps identify peak registration periods and impact of reminder notifications.

**Source Analytics**: Shows how users discovered the event (browsing, search, notification, shared link). Helps organizers understand effective promotion channels.

**Demographics Breakdown**: Pie charts showing distribution by department, year, and user role. Useful for understanding audience composition.

### 7.2 Participant Management

#### Registered Participants List

A searchable, sortable table displays all registered participants with columns for name, email, department, registration date, and status (confirmed/pending/cancelled). Organizers can export this list as CSV or Excel for external use.

#### Participant Actions

**Send Message**: Broadcast messages to all or selected participants through in-app notifications and email.

**Cancel Registration**: Remove a participant from the event (with notification). Useful for policy violations or duplicate registrations.

**Move to Waitlist**: Downgrade a confirmed registration if needed.

**Mark as Attended**: Manually mark attendance if QR check-in fails.

#### Waitlist Management

Separate tab shows waitlisted users in order. Organizers can manually promote waitlist users to confirmed if seats become available. Automated notifications go out when users move up the waitlist.

### 7.3 Post-Event Analytics

#### Attendance Analysis

After event completion, the dashboard shows attendance metrics including total attended vs. registered, no-show percentage, and late arrivals count. These statistics help improve future event planning.

#### Feedback Collection

Automated feedback forms are sent to attendees after event completion. Questions cover content quality, organization, venue satisfaction, and overall rating. Results appear in analytics dashboard with charts and average scores.

#### Certificate Generation

If certificates are enabled, organizers can bulk generate certificates for all attendees. The system uses the predefined template with automatic name and event detail insertion. Certificates are stored in Firebase Storage and participants receive download links.

---

## 8. Event Updates and Communication

### 8.1 Event Announcements

Organizers can post updates to registered participants through the event details screen. Announcements appear in a dedicated "Updates" tab and trigger push notifications. Use cases include venue changes, time modifications, additional instructions, or reminders about what to bring.

### 8.2 Discussion and Q&A

The Q&A section allows participants to ask questions that organizers can answer publicly. Other participants see all questions and answers. Organizers can pin important Q&As to the top. This feature reduces repetitive queries and ensures everyone has access to the same information.

### 8.3 Event Sharing

Users can share events via Android's native share functionality. The system generates a deep link that opens the event directly in the app for recipients who have it installed. For users without the app, the link opens a mobile-optimized web view with event details and download prompt.

---

## 9. Special Event Types

### 9.1 Recurring Events

Organizers can mark an event as recurring and set frequency (daily, weekly, monthly). The system creates separate event instances for each occurrence. Users can register for individual instances or all upcoming occurrences at once. Past instances remain visible in event history.

### 9.2 Multi-Day Events

Events spanning multiple days have separate date entries for each day. Registration covers all days by default. Attendance is tracked separately for each day. Users receive reminders before each day of the event.

### 9.3 Virtual Events

Online events include a "Join Meeting" button that appears 15 minutes before start time. Organizers add meeting links (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.) during creation. The link is only visible to registered participants. Attendance can be marked based on meeting participant lists.

---

## 10. Content Moderation

### 10.1 Event Approval System (Optional)

Institutions can enable admin approval for all events before publishing. Faculty submit events that enter pending status. Admins review event details, verify accuracy, and approve or request changes. This ensures quality control and prevents inappropriate content.

### 10.2 User Reporting

Users can report events for issues like inappropriate content, incorrect information, spam, or cancelled events not marked as such. Reports go to admin dashboard with reported content highlighted. Admins can remove events, contact organizers, or dismiss false reports.
